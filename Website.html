<h1>Building this website!</h1>
<p>Welcome to the front row seat to this little project. As a background I am an engineer of electronics, not a web developer, so this website will probably never be beautiful. Nonetheless, while for now it is all raw html, maybe I will add some css at a later point. I have an extremely bare bones knowledge of html from experience using online forums in my youth at least. Stuff like <b>bold</b>, <i>italic</i>, and even marquee but perhaps that is best left in the late 2000s.</p>
<p>I did design a website for my A levels, but we used Adobe Dreamweaver, which held you hand a lot more than GitHub Pages will do. So, wish me luck! &#127881;</p>
