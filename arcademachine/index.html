    <h1>Arcade Build Blog</h1>
    <p>So my partner and I are both huge nerds, although in different flavours. I'm a jack of all trades tinkerer, an enjoyer of sampling every hobby going. He is a gamer through and through, with a love of retro design sensibilities such as a focus on gameplay above all else and the importance of atmosphere.</p>
<p>So since I'm newly graduated, and the Finnish job market is not the best right now, we figured why not build an arcade cabinet?</p>

      <h2>Picked My Parts</h2>
      <p class="date">Aug 13, 2025</p>
      <p>After a search online I found there were two "cores" people used for building arcade cabinets. The first was using a micro-PC, which would handle more or less everything depending on the model. I would probably have to design the controller unit, and that's it. The second is using a Raspberry Pi, which is weaker than a micro-PC but a bit more involved. The Raspberry Pi 4 can struggle with some games within the PS1/N64/Xbox generation, which would be a shame as a potential upgrade path once this is built would be a lightgun setup with Time Crisis 2. However with any luck the Raspberry Pi 5 would be able to handle most games of this generation. My partner isn't interested in any games beyond this generation, so that should work fine. So, since it'll be more fun, we went the RPi route.</p>
<p>Pimoroni sell the Picade, which is pretty much all the parts to build one, wooden case included. They also sell the Max, which is larger and allows two player. However, my partner requested a larger screen, not really caring for the retro 5:4 or 4:3 ratio Pimoroni offer. He would also like the machine to be a 2 player setup. So, I decided to buy the controller and audio boards from Pimoroni and handle the rest myself.</p>
