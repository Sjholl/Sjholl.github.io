    <h1>A retrospective for my PC build</h1>
    <p>This project was completed before I made this website! When I graduated, I owned a geriatric Acer Nitro N50-600 prebuild that I bought shortly after emigrating to Finland. It had served me perfectly fine over the years, albeit lacking the specs to play the most recent games, but graphical upgrades to the game Final Fantasy XIV in 2024 had finally pushed it beyond its limit. As such, it was time for an upgrade. So, as a graduation present, I decided to try my hand at building my next PC. My main uses for my PC other than the standard browser and social chat program were 2D art, 3D modelling, circuit and PCB design. Therefore a midrange machine would do fine.</p>
