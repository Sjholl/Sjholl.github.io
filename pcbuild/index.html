    <h1>A retrospective for my PC build</h1>
    <p>This project was completed before I made this website! When I graduated, I owned a geriatric Acer Nitro N50-600 prebuild that I bought shortly after emigrating to Finland. It had served me perfectly fine over the years, albeit lacking the specs to play the most recent games, but graphical upgrades to the game Final Fantasy XIV in 2024 had finally pushed it beyond its limit. As such, it was time for an upgrade. So, as a graduation present, I decided to try my hand at building my next PC. My main uses for my PC other than the standard browser and social chat program were 2D art, 3D modelling, circuit and PCB design. Therefore a midrange machine would do fine.</p>

      <h2>Welcome to the build!</h2>
      <p class="date">26th June 2025</p>
      <p>The last part to arrive was the case. I very nearly missed the delivery too - not because I wasn't home, but because the delivery guy couldn't get in. In short, our phone buzzer had been removed in favour of a door code, which was abused by a teen living in the building letting all his mates come in and litter all over the place so they disabled it. Unfortunately, as the code lock is still there, many delivery people get frustrated why we won't give them a code. Sorry, we have to let you in manually! I had to sprint down the stairs, threw the front door open, to see the delivery guy just about to get back into his van. Phew! barely! As for the kid, his mum apologised on our local facebook group with a selfie of herself and her son (looking sheepish), which was nice of her at least. Wish they'd do something about it so we can let people in though.</p>
      <p>Anyway, as previously stated I got a Fractal Pop Air. The colour is a nice high-vis orange in person. The case is solid, with no loose joints or misshapen panels. One thing I was very pleasantly surprised about was how meticulous the instillation manual for the case was. Since this was my first build, I thought all cases must be this good, until a friend got a Phanteks XT and found the manual severely lacking. But yes! Fractal cases don't have the most efficient internal form factor but they're pretty good!</p>
      <img src="../images/pcbuild/thestart.jpg" alt="Case and manual on the table" />
      <p>And with that, we begin! First I removed the mobo from the static protection bag and installed the CPU.</p>
      <img src="../images/pcbuild/installingcpu.jpg" alt="Installing the CPU" />
      <p>Then, I installed the M.2 SSD and RAM, making sure to remove the plastic film from the SSD. The mobo recommended placing the RAM into slots A2 and B2, so that's what I did.</p>
      <img src="../images/pcbuild/installedram.jpg" alt="Mobo with installed M2 drive and RAM." />
      <p>With those installed, it was time to install the mobo into the case. With that done, I decided to install the AIO. Spoiler: this was a mistake! I had to remove the AIO to get to the connection points at the top of the mobo. Connect the wires first. I was just worried about scratching things up and wanted things locked in place asap. And yes, I remembered to take the plastic film off the AIO heatsink. To be fair, they had printed all across it in massive red letters to do so, so I think you need to be assembling this with your eyes closed to do otherwise. I also think I might have used slightly too much thermal paste, but since it's non-conductive a tiny bit of spill over shouldn't be an issue (except for future me).</p>
      <p>I installed the GPU, most of the wiring, uninstalled the AIO fans from the case, finished wiring, then reinstalled the AIO fans. Nice.</p>
      <img src="../images/pcbuild/internalsdone.jpg" alt="Assembled PC tower." />
      <p>Then, once the PSU was installed, I connected the tower to my monitor, plugged it in, and hit the power switch... and nothing.</p>
      <p>Devestated. Well, perhaps that was hyperbole. I had looked a lot into PC building before getting started, so my first thought was I had messed up the power connection somehow. After all, it wasn't like the PC was spinning up then stopping. It was completely inert. And woops! I had connected POWER SW to the POWER LED header on the mobo. Once I connected it to the correct header, it worked! Wow, I hope all my problems could be solved this easily.</p>
      <p>Anyway, with that, there was the final touch. I have talked before about the AeroCool Skribble, and while I knew I didn't want it due to the glass front panel, I knew I wanted to take inspiration from it. This is why I decided on the Fractal Pop Air over the Fractal North! Inspired heavily by the artist <b>robobesito</b> on Tumblr, I copied two of their pictures to create both my and my partner's Final Fantasy XIV characters and put them together rushing into battle. Why those two? Well, because we met in this game. When his group was requesting a fourth person to join for a run of the very first Deep Dungeon. If we never had met, I would still be working in a supermarket in the UK. So, here is the finished result! I love how the RGB fans interact with the chalk lines on the glass. Please don't mind the state of my keyboard, I am a newly graduated student after all!</p>

      <p>This was loads of fun, and I have already promised to build my partner's next PC since this went so smoothly. This thing runs silently, which is a world of difference to my old jumbo jet of a PC. I set the RGB fans to alternate between reds, oranges and yellows, to fit with the case.</p>
      <p>By the way, the dimensions of the transparent part of the glass panel for the Pop Air are 325mm by 455mm. Since I couldn't find that information online. If you want to do something similar yourself and need to print out a template to follow.</p>

      <h2>The parts are ordered!</h2>
      <p class="date">8th June 2025</p>
      <p>Hey so, I gratuated! On the 6th. So, as a reward and with everything finalised, I ordered the following parts:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Fractal Design Pop Air, in orange</li>
        <li>B650 plus wifi mobo</li>
        <li>Ryzen 5 7600X CPU</li>
	<li>Arctic Liquid Freezer III 240 AIO</li>
	<li>GeForce RTX 5060 Ti</li>
	<li>DDR5-6000 CL36 RAM</li>
	<li>2TB M.2 SSD</li>
	<li>850W modular PSU</li>
      </ul>
      <p>And, of course, thermal paste. The reason for upgrading the PSU was because the shop I decided to go with had it on offer for cheaper than the 750W I was looking at before. I decided to go with Proshop.fi, as Verkkokauppa did not have the case in stock. This was a bit of a gamble, as we had never used it before and this was one hell of a shop to test it out on. But the reviews said Proshop was reliable, just very slow. And I didn't really mind slow, so we risked it. This turned out to be a blessing, as they were cheaper than the competitors on pretty much everything I was ordering. Similarly, I downgraded the AIO to one without a screen as I found it difficult to justify the additional cost for something I can just use software to check.</p>

      <h2>First Build Attempt</h2>
      <p class="date">16th May 2025</p>
      <p>You know before, I was looking at the Fractal Design North. It is a really handsome case, with lovely wooden slats running vertically across the front face. This case looks beautiful regardless of using RGB; in fact I would argue it looks better without, except maybe the front intake fans if you have them set to a nice warm firey colour.</p>
      <p>That was, until I found the Aerocool Skribble (image courtesy of Overclockers UK).</p>
      <img src="../images/pcbuild/AerocoolSkribble.jpg" alt="The Aerocool Skribble case." />
      <p>You see that column that runs up the edge between the front panel and the side? Yeah, that has RGB LEDs inside. They shine into the edges of the glass panels. The drawings are done in chalk - assumedly on the inside of the panel rather than the outside so it can't get smudged - and the reflected RGB makes it appear to glow. Looks amazing, right?</p>
      <p>The only thing is, I don't really like the glass panel on the front. I'd want to keep that as a fan intake to help with heating and fan volume. Of course, it isn't hard to just buy a chalk pen and do it yourself. Sure, it won't have the LED strips to make it really glow, but you can get LEDs so small these days you could probably DIY it. Except would totally clash with the elegance of the North. Bah!</p>
      <p>A case I did find while looking, however, was the Fractal Pop Air. These cases were designed to run cool and quiet, but have the fun gimmick of the internal metal being a different colour to the external. The one I saw in a review was black on the outside, and bright blue on the inside. Nice! And would fit a lot better with a chalk drawing on the glass reflecting some RGB lighting. Blue is a nice enough colour. Not my favourite, but midd- wait they also come in orange?! Jackpot!</p>
      <p>And thus I decided on an orange Pop Air for the case.</p>
