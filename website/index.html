    <h1>Building this website!</h1>
    <p>Welcome to the front row seat to this little project. As a background I am an engineer of electronics, not a web developer, so this website will probably never be beautiful. Nonetheless, while for now it is all raw html, maybe I will add some css at a later point. I have an extremely bare bones knowledge of html from experience using online forums in my youth at least. Stuff like <b>bold</b>, <i>italic</i>, and even marquee but perhaps that is best left in the late 2000s.</p>
<p>I did design a website for my A levels, but we used Adobe Dreamweaver, which held you hand a lot more than GitHub Pages will do. So, wish me luck! &#127881;</p>

      <h2>Adding css</h2>
      <p class="date">22nd August</p>
      <p>I decided, just to get started, to ask chatGPT for a basic css template. Yes, I know, chatGPT is a very contientous topic. I guess this makes me officially a vibe coder!</p>
      <p>Nonetheless this is the result. I may modify it later, but for now the website actually resembles what I want it to be. One thing I want to do is make it permanently in dark mode. My browser is set to automatically set pages to dark mode if availible, which causes an annoying flash when I load into this website as it initially loads the default before changing to dark. Dark mode is so much more pleasant on my eyes, so I would prefer that to be the default.

      <h2>The journey begins</h2>
      <p class="date">4th August 2025</p>
      <p>So to begin with, I researched places where I could host a website for free. This didn't take long, as GitHub Pages came up as one of the first results and had some good documentation on how to get started. I knew I wanted to have a launch page which directed you to some blog stype project pages, so I set up some very basic pages. Without css these were extremely basic, and at the time I did not bother to even include a return to main link.</p>
